# nickel-bootstrap

A seed implementation of nickel/bootstrap

# Getting started

1. [Install the latest version of rust](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-alpha.2/book/installing-rust.html).
2. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/ninjabear/nickel-bootstrap)
3. Use ```cargo run``` to build and run it.

Providing everything went swimmingly - you should have nickel-bootstrap loaded and listening on ```127.0.0.1:6767```.

# Moving on

This is intended as a starting point for your own [nickel.rs](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs) webapps. nickel-bootstrap is under the MIT licence, feel free to turn it into whatever you wish.

## Where to start

I've picked some directories for holding files, but nickel is hot off the press, things haven't stabilized yet. 

* I put my mustache templates in ./templates
* I put my static files in ./public
* Routes are configured in ./src/main.rs

# Contributing
